% Comment on any disparities between model predictions and experimental values.  What are possible causes of discrepancies?
There are discrepancies between the predicted theoretical and experimental elastic moduli. This difference is also reflected in the failure loads. The experimental elastic modulus is lower for the $0\degree$ and $90\degree$ laminate orientation specimens. A possible cause of this is the fiber direction not being exactly aligned when the composite was made. Another possibility is imperfections in the composite from either the layering process or curing. Unlike the other two samples, the 45$\degree$ specimen has a greater experimental elastic modulus compared to its predicted theoretical. A possible reason for this is that the fibers were set at an orientation closer to 0$\degree$, giving the specimen greater experimental tensile strength.
