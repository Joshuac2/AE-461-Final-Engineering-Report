\subsection{Manufacturing Apparatus}
\tab A set DA 409U/G35 150 prepeg sheets were provided for the purposes of designing and forming both the $0\degree$ and $45\degree$ specimens.  A sharp utility knife was provided to slice the sheets into the proper dimensions.  Due to the high sensitivity to local humidity and temperature, the manufacturing process was done in a large, well ventilated room with an analog hygrometer/digital thermometer.  The analog hygrometer had a relative humidity accuracy of 2.5\% and resolution of 1.0\%; the digital thermometer had an accuracy of $1.5\degree$F and resolution of $0.1\degree$F.  For the purpose of weighing the specimen prior to cure, an electronic top loading balance scale was provided with a linearity of $\pm 0.001$ grams and $4.0$ second stabilization time.  During the measuring, cutting, and assembling of the specimen, slightly unconventional methods of chilling the composite were used to rapidly decrease the local temperature of the material to prevent premature curing and mitigate the slow increase of void content in the composite matrix.
