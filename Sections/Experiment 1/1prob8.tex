% What would happen if the applied pressure was raised to a higher pressure? How about a lower pressure?
An important aspect of the curing process is the pressure applied.  Different thermoset composite materials require different pairings of temperature and pressure applied during the curing process.  Earlier, it was discussed how an increase or decrease in temperature can directly impact the quality of the cured specimen.  Similarly, the applied pressure has a major role in determining the material quality. \hl{INCOMPLETE WILL FINISH THIS CRAP LATER}
