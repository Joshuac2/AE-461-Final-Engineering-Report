% Calculate the force needed to be applied by the hot press platens to achieve 150 psi on the specimens.

In order to achieve 150 psi of pressure on the specimen, the hot press must apply a total of at least 1,050 lbf. Each specimen is 1x7 inches. By distributing the pressure evenly to all 7 sq inches, 1,050 lbf is needed. However, note that the force required is likely slightly higher since this calculation assumes the total contact area is exactly the same area as the specimen area. In reality, given all the mounting hardware and mold, the contact area must be higher than the specimen size.
