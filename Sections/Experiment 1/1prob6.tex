% Comment on the quality of the manufactured specimens.  (Where there any problems during lay-up or cure which may impact the mechanical performance?)
In an ordinary semester, without the Covid-19 quarantine situation, the specimen would be removed from their molds after curing and the condition observed.  Due to state-wide shutdown, it was not possible for students to physically retrieve the specimen and observe its condition.  According to an email from Professor Ioannis Chasiotis, dated May 8, 2020, the thickness of the specimen decreased.  With this observation, the only inference possible without physical observation is that the platens have sunk deeper into the mold following the curing process.
