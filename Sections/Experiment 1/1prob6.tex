% Comment on the quality of the manufactured specimens.  (Where there any problems during lay-up or cure which may impact the mechanical performance?)
In an ordinary semester, without the nCoV-19 quarantine situation, the specimen would be removed from their molds after curing and the condition observed.  Due to state-wide shutdown, it was not possible for students to physically retrieve the specimen and observe its condition.  According to an email from \emph{Professor Dr. Ioannis Chasiotis}, dated May 8, 2020 -- quote: the thickness of the specimen decreased.  With this observation, the only inference possible without physical observation is that the platens have sunk deeper into the mold following the curing process.
