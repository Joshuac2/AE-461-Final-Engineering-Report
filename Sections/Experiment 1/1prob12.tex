% When does compaction of the composite laminate take place during the cure cycle? (Hint: When does the platen height change dramatically during the cure cycle?)

Compaction of the composite takes place during the initial temperature rise of the single-step cure cycle. The pressure applied is constant throughout the curing process. As the temperature increases, the resin viscosity decreases, allowing the platen to compact the laminate. After enough exposure to the high temperature, the resin viscosity lowers and the laminate begins to set. The setting is complete after the cure cycle has ended.
