Composite materials have been investigated in this lab and were found to have properties that can be useful for aerospace applications. This lab has been broken down in two main experiments. The first portion of this lab was focused on the fabrication of multiple specimens of composites. Three different specimens with varying fiber directions were created. Based on pre published data sheets value, the fabricated specimens were reasonably on specification. Its densities, thickness, and fiber volumetric fractions were within 15\% of specification. However, its volumetric shrinkage percentage was significantly different, where a 70\% reduction was expected however only a 33\% reduction was observed. This could be attributed to imprecise manufacturing techniques resulting in excess material and voids in the composite. The second portion of the lab was focused on testing the performance of the specimens. Here, the effect of the fiber laminate angles becomes evident.
