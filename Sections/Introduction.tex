Composite materials make up a substantial volume of modern structures.  The generally low weight but high strength properties of composites result in a material which is more efficient and highly desirable for aerospace applications.  This experiment is broken into two stages: the manufacturing of and mechanical property testing of composite materials.  In experiment \#1, three polymer matrix composite specimen will be manufactured from DA 409U/G35 150 prepreg sheets with fiber directions $0\degree$, $45\degree$, and $90\degree$.  A hot press method of manufacturing will complete the cure process, resulting in a similar material used in thin skin structures.  It is important to note that many steps in Experiment \#1, such as the cure procedure, will be programmed and completed by the lab faculty.  In experiment \#6, the three specimen will be tested in an Instron Model 4483 loading machine to test the material properties.
