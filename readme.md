*The following repository contains the necessary .tex files to compile our group's AE 461 Full Engineering Report for Spring 2020.  There is a "\Pictures\" folder which is further broken into its respective sections to separate photos and diagrams by section.  The "\Sections\" folder provides a directory path for .tex files.  Edits should ONLY be made to individual .tex files within these directories.  Modifying .tex files outside of this directory could result in a failure to compile.*
